A twitter bot that is meant to learn from its own performance

The bot is based on the original implementation called Twitter-follow-bot. I felt the purpose of this bot is different enough that it deserves its own implementation.

The idea is to make a bot which will learn what sort of actions create good engagement and which actions do not.

This project is a mostly a way for me to learn more about AI and how to use it in an actual practical project.
